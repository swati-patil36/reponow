Here's a sample documentation you can use for your README or project notes regarding your experience using Copilot for copilot_test.py:

## Experience Using Copilot

### What code did Copilot generate?
I used GitHub Copilot to help generate a Python script (`copilot_test.py`) that prints the system uptime. Copilot suggested a function that checks the operating system and retrieves the uptime either by reading `/proc/uptime` on Unix/Linux systems or using `net stats srv` on Windows. The generated code included all necessary imports and proper formatting for the output.

### Did you modify the script? If so, why?
Yes, I made minor modifications:
- Added comments for clarity.
- Ensured compatibility for both Unix/Linux and Windows systems.
- Improved the formatting of the output for readability.
- Added a main function guard (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to allow the script to be run directly.

### How did you test it?
I tested the script by running it on a Linux machine and verified that it correctly reported the system uptime in hours and minutes. For Windows, I reviewed the code logic and confirmed that the command used (`net stats srv`) provides the expected result, though actual testing was done primarily on Linux.

## How to Run the Script

To run `copilot_test.py` and print your system's uptime:

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/swati-patil36/reponow.git
    cd reponow
    ```

2. **Run the script** using Python:

    ```bash
    python copilot_test.py
    ```

    Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

**Note:**  
- On Unix/Linux, the script reads `/proc/uptime` directly.
- On Windows, it uses the built-in `net stats srv` command.
